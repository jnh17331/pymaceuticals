These dataframes and charts go over mice with tumors and their drug treatment over time. We can see in the combined_data(the main dataframe) that there are varying identified mice that all have different ages, weights, and treatments that they undergo. Later on in the notebook, you can get the data of a particular mouse, a group of mice, or other variables from the combined_data data frame. Some of the graphs also show the effectiveness of each drug regimen through comparision with all the other drug regimens, in particular focus, Capomulin.
